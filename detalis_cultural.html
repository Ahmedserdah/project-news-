        <p >A farmer found a stone statue in the Gaza Strip of the Canaanite goddess of beauty, love and war.
            <br>
            Palestinian archaeologists say that the head of the Canaanite goddess "Anat" dates back 4,500 years, in the late Bronze Age.
            <br>
            The farmer, Nidal Abu Eid, found the artifact during excavations on his land, in Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip.
            <br>
            And via social media, some Gazans made sarcastic comments suggesting that the goddess' association with war seemed appropriate.
            <br>
            In the past few years, they have witnessed a series of devastating explosions in the conflict between Israel and armed groups in the Gaza Strip,
            <br>which is run by the Hamas movement.
            <br>
        </p>

        The discovery of the limestone statue reminds that the sector - part of an important trade route for successive ancient civilizations - was originally a Canaanite settlement.
        <br>
        The 22 cm high sculpture shows the face of the goddess wearing a crown.
        <br>
        Farmer Nidal Abu Eid said, "We found it by chance. It was covered in mud, and we washed it with water."
        <br>
        He told the BBC: "We knew it was a valuable thing, but we didn't know it had great archaeological value."
        <br>
        And he added: "We thank God and we are proud of Him, because he has remained in our land, in Palestine, since the Canaanite era."
        <br>
        The statue of "Anat" - one of the most famous Canaanite deities - is displayed in the Pasha Palace, a historical building that is used as one of Gaza's few museums.
