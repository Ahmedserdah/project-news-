               <p >Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the West for the war in Ukraine, during his Victory Day address.<br>
                   He said that the past year witnessed tension with European countries, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "NATO",<br> adding that Russia "is urging Europe for a just settlement, but they do not want to listen" to our demands.<br>
                   <br>
                   It appeared at the beginning of an attack inside Ukraine last February.<br>

                   Nor did I make an important announcement in Putin's speech, as some expected.<br>

                   Many countries in the world look at the Arab countries.<br>
                   <br>
                   In his speech, the Russian president said that Russian troops and volunteers in the Donbass region of eastern<br> Ukraine were "fighting for the motherland and its future", and accused the West of preparing to "invade our land".<br>
                   <br>

                  He added that his "special military operation" was necessary and was the "right decision."<br>
                  Putin vowed that the state would do "everything" to take care of families grieving the bereavement caused by the Ukraine war.<br>

                  "The death of any soldier or officer is painful for us," he said.<br>

                  The Russian president referred to the tension with European countries and NATO,<br> saying that they were preparing for a punitive operation in Donbass in eastern Ukraine.
                  <br>
                  “In Kyiv they were saying that they might get nuclear weapons, and NATO began to explore the lands close to us,<br> and that became a clear threat to our country and our borders. Everything indicated that there was a need to fight,” he said.

                      The Russian president began his Victory Day speech on Moscow's Red Square by telling Russian<br> fighters that they are fighting for Russia's security.<br>

                      He congratulated the veterans on "Great Victory Day", which celebrates the Soviet Union's<br> victory over Nazi Germany in World War II in 1945.<br>

                      Putin called for a minute of silence in memory of the Russians killed in World War II,<br> and the soldiers fighting for Russia in the Donbass.<br>

                      He ended his speech amid the cheers of soldiers in Red Square, artillery fire and the Russian national anthem.<br>

                      The celebration featured thousands of soldiers and an air show - including the plane <br>that Putin would use in the event of a nuclear conflict.<br>
