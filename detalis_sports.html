        <p >The Egyptian Al-Ahly club demanded that the final match of the African Champions League be held on a neutral ground,<br> after its first leg victory in the semi-final against Algeria's ES Setif.
            <br>
            The defending champion easily defeated its guest, Setif, who played with a shortage of ten players after 35 minutes,<br> scoring four clean goals in Saturday's match.
            <br>
            In Saturday's semi-final match, Morocco's Wydad Casablanca defeated Angola's Petro Atletico, 3-1.
            <br>
        </p>

    <img src="images/sports news/alahly.jpg" alt="buten" class="img-responsive img-curve" style="width: 700px;height: 350px ;margin-left:30px;margin-top: 15px ;margin-bottom: 10px">
    <p style="margin-left:30px;margin-right: 30px;line-height:35px ">
        And the 10-time African champion said: "Since (CAF) did not announce the country that will host the match early,<br>
        giving one party an advantage by holding the final in its country and among its fans at the expense of <br>
        the other party ... contradicts the rules of fair play."

        Percy Tau opened Al-Ahly's shot half an hour later, and the Algerian team's player,<br>
        Amir Karoui, was sent off five minutes later.

        Karoui was exposed to the red card after blocking Hussein Al-Shahat's foot,<br>
        as the referee changed the yellow card to red after seeing the error on the "VAR" screen.

        Then Tao added his second goal in the last minute of the match after scoring two goals for Taher Mohamed and Mohamed Sharif earlier.

        In the other quarter-final match, the start was unfortunate for the captain of the Petro Atletico team, <br>
        Thiago Azulao, who put the ball into his own net in the 16th minute.

        Then, Wydad's other goals followed, which were scored by the team's captain, Yahya Gibran, and the Congolese Gay Mbenza.

        The team, the hosts, played with a lack of numbers nine minutes before the end of the match, and to compensate for the defeat,<br>
        Petro must score at least three goals in Friday's first leg in Casablanca, where Wydad won the group stage last month,<br>
        scoring five goals to one.

        Despite this, the Angolans will travel to Morocco on Friday without Brazilian midfielder, William Soares, who was shown a red<br>
        card in extra time after being seen twice.
